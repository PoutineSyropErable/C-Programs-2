The fact that I'm using gdi32 and writting pixels to the screen will trip the **** out of your antivirus
It sure did mine. (Needed to set exception or else I couldn't even work on it)

Future notes in the case that this is seen by a beginner. 
I would recommend you to look at the code and compile it yourself (For security reasons).

gotta change in main.bat the link to 
"D:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x86_amd64 so that it has your version of 
visual studio developper command prompt. It's normally in C. If you don't have the tools, gotta download them.

If you are on linux, I'll assume you know how to compile a C file.
